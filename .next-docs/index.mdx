Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

## How to use the docs
